**Comment Breeze**

This is a web app I made to help my friends and other ESL / TESOL teachers build report card comments. With a database full of comments it allows you to search and filter though them to find ones you want and build a whole report card with it.

**Setup**

See the file Setup.txt for information about how to run this yourself.

**License**

The MIT license. Basically you can use this however you want.
