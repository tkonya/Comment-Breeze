**Comment Breeze**

This is a web app I made to help my friends and other ESL / TESOL teachers build report card comments. With a database full of comments it allows you to search and filter though them to find ones you want and build a whole report card with it.

Site is currently live at: http://comment-breeze.xyz/

**Stack**

The initial stack was: MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS, Java backend REST API with Jersey running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Angular JS frontend with Material Design. After comparing the AWS bills to the donations, the site was refactored to be a plain static site, frozen in time. Now the AWS bill is about 3% of what it used to be.


**Setup**

See the file Setup.txt for information about how to run this yourself.
