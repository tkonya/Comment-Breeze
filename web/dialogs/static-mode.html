            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Static mode is a feature-limited version of the site I made that does not require a database to run.<br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Why is the site in static mode?</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                1. I have to pay for the servers<br>
                2. There have never been any donations to help pay for the servers<br>
                3. It's cheaper to run the site without a database, so I lose less money every month<br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">What is different about static mode?</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Nobody can rate, tag or edit comments. The contact form doesn't work.<br>
                Essentially comments will not be updated while the site is like this.
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">When will the site go back into non-static mode?</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                When there are more monthly users or there are some donations.<br>
            </p>
