                Patterns allows you to build a sentence-by-sentence template that your comment or comments will conform to.
                This could be a default pattern applied to all students, a pattern to base grading off of, or an individual pattern for just one student.
                Each pattern piece you add will look for one sentence matching the search criteria you set.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Setup:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                The default pattern can be created or edited by just selecting the tab, as long as you are not currently editing a student's individual pattern.
                Text above the search box will tell you what pattern you are currently editing.
                A student's individual pattern can be added or edited by selecting "Edit w/ Patterns" from their menu on the build tab, or selecting them from the box at the top (assuming you have added students by this point).
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Building a pattern:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Add pattern pieces one by one, each piece represents 1 sentence, in the order you add them.
                If you just want a piece to be totally random then leave the Search Text empty and the filter set to "Any".
                Repeat until you have added and configured one piece for each sentences you would like in the comment.<br><br>

                Example: If you want your first sentence to be about "behavior" then type that in and hit "Add Pattern Piece"<br><br>

                Search Text looks in both the comment text and any tags that have been added to the comment for matches.
                Select if you would like this comment to have a certain tone (positive, neutral or negative).
                Hit "Add Pattern Piece" and repeat for all other sentences you would like to add.
                If a search did not return any results or you are unsatisfied with the result, you can modify it below
                and regenerate.<br><br>

                When building the default pattern the specific comment search results are not important, as new results
                will be generated when the pattern is applied to a new or existing user. For individual patterns they
                represent an actual part of a comment, and changing them would change the comment.<br><br>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Grading Students:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                A common use-case is to want all of the contents of your comments to be homogeneous, but to grade
                students differently on each subject.<br><br>

                To do this follow these steps:<br><br>

                1. Create a default pattern that contains one pattern piece with search text for each subject you want
                to cover. You can optionally skip this step and the grading function will just use a default pattern.<br><br>

                2. Add all of your students on the build tab, filling in class name, and introduction and conclusion if
                desired.<br><br>

                3. Go to the "All Students" menu and click "Grade All Students".<br><br>

                4. Select the tone for each pattern piece in the default pattern for current student.<br><br>

                5. Hit save when you are done. Another window will be opened up for the next student, until you complete
                the last student.<br><br>
