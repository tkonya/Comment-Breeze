                Enter your student's names, as you would like them to appear in the comments, one after another by
                selecting their gender, typing their name on the "New Student Name" line and then hitting enter or press the "Add"
                button after each one.<br><br>

                Tip: You may put a space after the students name and an "m" or "f" to set their gender. For example I
                could enter in "Jimmy f", hit enter, and the page would add a female student named "Jimmy".
                If you don't add one of those letters after the student's name to determine gender it will be whatever
                gender is currently selected in the "Add Students" box.<br><br>

                By default a totally random comment whenever a new student is added, but you may also choose to start
                blank or generate a comment based on the default pattern (if you have defined a default pattern).<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Setting Gender:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                You can set the gender of the student to be added one of 2 ways:<br>
                1. With the Male/Female/Neutral radio button<br>
                2. You may put a space after the students name and an "m" or "f" to set their gender.<br><br>

                Example: For example I could enter in "Jimmy f", hit enter, and the page would add a female student named "Jimmy".
                If you don't add one of those letters after the student's name to determine gender it will be whatever
                gender is currently selected in the "Add Students" box.<br><br>

                If you set the gender with a capital letter ("M" or "F") it will also change the default gender. This could be useful if you have several students
                in a row that are the same gender.<br><br>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Initial Comment:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                By default a totally random comment whenever a new student is added, but you may also choose to start
                blank.<br><br>

                A third option is to make a default pattern and have all new students added start with comments conforming to
                the default pattern. Each student added with the default pattern will have a new comment generated based on the pattern.<br><br>
