                The class name is strongly recommeded, as many comments have the variable "CLASS_NAME" in them that should be replaced with something.
                If your class does not have a name you should start with something generic like "English Class" and then edit it out later if it sounds weird.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Introduction and Conclusion:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                The introduction and conclusion are optional sentences that will be added to the beginning and end of each student's comments.
                They will not initially be visible when writing comments, but when you view finished comments or copy comments they will be appended.<br><br>

                You can use the variables "STUDENT_NAME" and "CLASS_NAME" (no quotes) in them, and they will be replaced with the correct value when copying or viewing finished comments.<br><br>
