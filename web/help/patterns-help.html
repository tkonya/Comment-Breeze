                The default pattern is a pattern that can be applied to new students or existing students, or it can be used as a basis to grade student off of.
                For the default pattern the search results it displays are just samples.
                This is because when the default pattern is applied to new or existing students we want to regenerate it for each one to get comments are unique.<br><br>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Individual Patterns:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Individual patterns are a way to build student comments in a modular way. You can edit a student's individual pattern by selecting "Edit w/ Patterns" in their menu on the build tab, or selecting them at the top of the Patterns tab.<br><br>

                When you first start editing an individual student with patterns the system will import their current comment into pattern format.
                The comment will not be erased or changed until you modify the pieces that make up that pattern.

                When editing a student's individual pattern the search result is the comment that will be used.
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Search Results:</h4>

                For the default pattern the search results it displays are just samples.
                This is because when the default pattern is applied to new or existing students we want to regenerate it for each one to get comments are unique.<br><br>

                When editing a student's individual pattern the search result is the comment that will be used. When you save the pattern it will create a whole comment out of the sum of all the pattern pieces.
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Editing Pieces:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                You can edit the search text or tone at any time. Changing either one will result in a new search being submitted.<br><br>

                If you are unsatisfied with a search result you can hit the "Regenerate" button.
                This will submit the search again and find another matching comment.
                If there are very few matches for your pattern it may return the same search result again.
                This would be a sign that your search is too narrow, and you should broaden it a little bit.
