                The default pattern can be created or edited by just selecting the tab, as long as you are not currently
                editing a student's individual pattern.
                A student's individual pattern can be added or edited by selecting "Edit w/ Patterns" from their menu.

                You can build the comment pattern sentence-by-sentence. So for your first sentence enter text you would
                like to search for, if any, on the "Search Text" line.
                Search Text looks in both the comment text and any tags that have been added to the comment for matches.
                Select if you would like this comment to have a certain tone (positive, neutral or negative).
                Hit "Add Pattern Piece" and repeat for all other sentences you would like to add.
                If a search did not return any results or you are unsatisfied with the result, you can modify it below
                and regenerate.<br><br>

                When building the default pattern the specific comment search results are not important, as new results
                will be generated when the pattern is applied to a new or existing user. For individual patterns they
                represent an actual part of a comment, and changing them would change the comment.

                A common use-case is to want all of the contents of your comments to be homogeneous, but to grade
                students differently on each subject.<br><br>

                To do this follow these steps:<br><br>

                1. Create a default pattern that contains one pattern piece with search text for each subject you want
                to cover.<br><br>

                2. Set the tone for each pattern piece as close to the class average as possible. You will be able to
                set the tone for each piece on a student-by-student basis later, but
                if most of your students are positive in one subject it would be easier to set that here than do it for
                each one.<br><br>

                3. Add all of your students on the build tab, filling in class name, and introduction and conclusion if
                desired..<br><br>

                4. Go to the "All Students" menu and click "Grade All Students". This will apply a derivative of the
                default pattern to each student*, allowing you to set the tone for each one.<br><br>

                5. Select the tone for each pattern piece in the default pattern for current student.<br><br>

                6. Hit save when you are done. Another window will be opened up for the next student, until you complete
                the last student.<br><br>

                *If you already have a pattern built for a student it will not overwrite it with the default pattern.
                You will be grading them on whatever pattern you had assigned to them before.
