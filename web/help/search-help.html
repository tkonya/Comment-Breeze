                Without any students added the search will only allow you to view, rate and tag comments.
                Once students have been added, clicking on a comment will add it to whichever student is currently selected.<br><br>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Finding and Adding Comments:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Search for a comment you would like to add by typing a word or short phrase on the "Search Comments"
                line above the list of comments.
                The search targets both the comment text and the tags, so if you want to find comments tagged with
                "writing", you can just search for that and comments tagged with "writing" will be returned, even if
                "writing" is not in the comment text. If you are looking for a comment with a certain tone you can
                select that in the box to the right of the
                search.<br><br>

                Click the comment text in the list to add it to your comments, or hit enter inside the search box to add
                the first search result and clear the search.<br><br>

                When a comment is added the system will attempt to replace STUDENT_NAME and CLASS_NAME with the appropriate values, and fix gendered pronouns to match the student that the comment is being added to.<br><br>

                Please remember that the gendered pronouns in English are not symmetrical so the site can get conversion wrong.
                For example the female equivalent of "his" could be either "her" or "hers"; the male equivalent of "her" could be either "him" or "his".
                Many comments have placeholders such as "him/her" to indicate what the pronoun will be for either gender. The correct one will be selected when adding it to a student.<br><br>

                Searching may be slow for mobile users or users with limited processing power (you have a crappy computer).
                Setting comments per page at the minimum value can help, or you can load only a partial set of the comments on the settings page.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Rating and Editing Comments:</h4>
            <p ng-style="state.theme.textColor">
                Anybody can set the tone of a comment in the list by clicking the icon to the left of it.
                This can help you and other users organize this list better.
                Anybody may also add or remove tags.
                If you have the editing password (basically if I know you in real life) then you can click the icon to
                the right to edit the text.
                If you don't have the editing password you can still flag a comment for attention if there is something
                wrong with it.<br><br>
