            <h3>Multi Student Comment Generation</h3>
        </div>

        <h4>Setup:</h4>
        <p>Enter the class name and select how many sentences you would like the randomly generated comment to contain<br><br>
            If you want all comments to start with the same introduction and/or conclusion then enter those on the "Your custom introduction" and "Your custom conclusion" lines.
            Custom introductions and conclusions will not be shown in the generated comments for the sake of saving space, but will be added to each student's comments at the end.
            You may use the variables CLASS_NAME and STUDENT_NAME in your introduction and conclusion, they will be replaced with the appropriate values when copied.
        </p>
        <h4>Adding Students:</h4>
        <p>Enter your student's names one after another by typing their name in the "Add Student" line and hitting enter after each one.<br>
            You may put a space after the students name and a "m", "f" or "n" to set their gender. For example I could enter in "Jimmy f" and the page would add a female student named "Jimmy".
            If you don't add a letter after the student's name to determine gender it will be whatever is currently selected for the default gender
        </p>
        <h4>Editing:</h4>
        <p>Edit comment manually as needed or use the regenerate and shuffle buttons to modify them automatically.
            You can edit any student on the single student tab by hitting the "Edit as Single Student" button. Just return to the Multi Student tab when you're done and your changes will automatically be applied.<br><br>
            Please remember that the gendered pronoun fixing is not perfect due to the male equivalent of "her" being either "him" or "his" and the site just guessing which one it is supposed to be. Proofreading is strongly advised.
        </p>
        <h4>Copying:</h4>
        <p>Hit copy button at the bottom to copy all comments with introductions and conclusions.<br>
            The student's name will be appended before each comment paragraph.
        </p>
