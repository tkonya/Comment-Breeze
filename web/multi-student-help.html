            <h2>Multi Student Comment Building</h2>
        </div>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Setup:</h4>
        <p>Enter the class name first.<br><br>
            If you want all comments to start with the same introduction and/or conclusion then enter those on the "Your custom introduction" and "Your custom conclusion" lines.
            Custom introductions and conclusions will not be shown in the generated comments for the sake of saving space, but will be added to each student's comments at the end.
            You may use the variables CLASS_NAME and STUDENT_NAME in your introduction and conclusion, they will be replaced with the appropriate values when copied.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Adding Students:</h4>
        <p>Enter your student's names, as you would like them to appear in the comments, one after another by typing their name in the "Add Student" line and hitting enter or press the "Add Student" button after each one.<br><br>
            You may put a space after the students name and an "m", "f" or "n" to set their gender. For example I could enter in "Jimmy f", hit enter, and the page would add a female student named "Jimmy".
            If you don't add one of those letters after the student's name to determine gender it will be whatever is currently selected for the default gender.<br><br>
            Normally adding a new student will just generate a totally random comment, but if you go to the Smart Search tab first you can configure a pattern to use for generating them. Return to the Multi Student tab and check "Use Smart Search" and any students added after that will have their comment generated according to what you defined in Smart Search.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Editing:</h4>
        <p>Edit comment manually as needed or use the regenerate and shuffle buttons to modify them automatically.
            You can edit any student on the single student tab by hitting the "Edit as Single Student" button. Just return to the Multi Student tab when you're done and your changes will be here.<br><br>
            Please remember that the gendered pronoun fixing is not perfect due to the male equivalent of "her" being either "him" or "his" and the site just guessing which one it is supposed to be. Proofreading is strongly advised.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Copying:</h4>
        <p>Hit copy button at the bottom to copy all comments with introductions and conclusions.
            The student's name will be appended before each comment paragraph.<br><br>
            You may also copy comments for just one student at a time by using the "Copy Comment" button to the right of their name. This will add the introduction and conclusion but not append their name to the beginning.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Smart Search + Multi Student:</h4>
        <p>
            The most powerful way to use this is by combining Multi Student and Smart Search.<br><br>

            To do this first go to the Smart Search tab and make a pattern, this will be the global pattern. After that go to the Multi Student tab, and start adding students as you otherwise normally would there.
            Instead of generating totally random comments it will generate a comment based on the pattern you've just defined. The global pattern will be applied to all of the students added, and you can regenerate their comment and have it conform to that pattern.<br><br>

            If you need to modify the pattern for any particular student(s), you can do that by clicking their menu and then going to "Edit Smart Search". This will take you back to the Smart Search tab where you can fine tune the pattern for individual students.
            The changes you make now will not affect other students, this pattern will be specifically for that student.
            This is helpful if you want to follow the same pattern of subjects for every student, but you would like to make them negative or positive depending on who the student is.<br><br>

            If you've already added students on the Multi Student tab you can apply a global pattern to all of them retroactively.
