                The default pattern can be created or edited by just selecting the tab, as long as you are not currently
                editing a student's individual pattern.
                A student's individual pattern can be added or edited by selecting "Edit w/ Patterns" from their menu.

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Building a pattern:</h4>
            <p>
                You can build the comment pattern sentence-by-sentence. So for your first sentence enter text you would
                like to search for, if any, on the "Search Text" line.
                Search Text looks in both the comment text and any tags that have been added to the comment for matches.
                Select if you would like this comment to have a certain tone (positive, neutral or negative).
                Hit "Add Pattern Piece" and repeat for all other sentences you would like to add.
                If a search did not return any results or you are unsatisfied with the result, you can modify it below
                and regenerate.<br><br>

                When building the default pattern the specific comment search results are not important, as new results
                will be generated when the pattern is applied to a new or existing user. For individual patterns they
                represent an actual part of a comment, and changing them would change the comment.
            </p>

            <h4 ng-style="state.theme.highlightColor">Grading Students:</h4>
            <p>
                A common use-case is to want all of the contents of your comments to be homogeneous, but to grade
                students differently on each subject.<br><br>

                To do this follow these steps:<br><br>

                1. Add a default pattern that contains search text but does not filter on positive or negative.<br><br>

                2. Add all of your students, making sure that "Generate w/ Default Pattern" is selected in the Add
                Students box.<br><br>

                3. After all of your students are added go to the first one and select "Edit w/ Search" from their menu.<br><br>

                4. Select positive or negative for each pattern piece that you want to rate them on. <br><br>

                5. Repeat steps 3 - 4 all subsequent students.<br><br>

                Tip: You can make your comments appear more unique by shuffling the order for each student.
