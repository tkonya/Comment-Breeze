            <h2>Single Student Comment Building</h2>
        </div>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Setup:</h4>
        <p>Enter the name of your class and the name of the student you are going to first build a comment for on the "Class Name" and "Student Name" lines respectively. Enter these as you would like them to appear in the comments, so generally just their first/given name. Select what gender the student is.<br><br>
            If you want all comments to start with the same introduction and/or conclusion then enter those on the "Your custom introduction" and "Your custom conclusion" lines.
            You may use the variables CLASS_NAME and STUDENT_NAME in your introduction and conclusion, they will be replaced with the appropriate values when copied.
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Finding a Comment:</h4>
        <p>Search for a comment you would like to add by typing a word or short phrase on the "Search Comments" line above the list of comments.
            Click the comment text in the list to add it to your comments.
            If you are looking for a comment with a certain tone you can select that in the box to the right of the search.
            Searching may be slow for mobile users or users with limited processing power (you have a crappy computer). Setting comments per page at the minimum value can help slightly.
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Just Make Something Up:</h4>
        <p>The "Just Make Something Up" button will pick a random set of comments from the entire list and set that as your comment (overwriting whatever is currently there).
            You may select the number of sentences you would like this button to pick on the settings tab.
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Editing Your Comment:</h4>
        <p>Edit comment manually as needed or use the shuffle button to scramble the order of the sentences in it.<br><br>
            Please remember that the gendered pronoun fixing is not perfect due to the male equivalent of "her" being either "him" or "his" and the site just guessing which one it is supposed to be. Proofreading is strongly advised.</p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Rating and Editing Comments:</h4>
        <p>Anybody can set the tone of a comment in the list by clicking the icon to the left of it.
            This can help you and other users organize this list better.
            If you have the editing password (basically if I know you in real life) then you can click the icon to the right to edit the text.
            If you don't have the editing password you can still flag a comment for attention if there is something wrong with it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Copying:</h4>
        <p>When you are satisfied with the comment you can hit the "Copy Comments" button to copy the entire comment.<br>
            The introduction and conclusion will be added to the beginning and end if you entered them.
            If you put the variables STUDENT_NAME or CLASS_NAME in the intro or conclusion they will be replaced in the copied text.
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellow-color">Subsequent Students:</h4>
        <p>Hitting the "Reset Comments" button will prepare you to do the next student by erasing the current student name and comments.
            The class name, gender, introduction and conclusion will not be changed.
        </p>
