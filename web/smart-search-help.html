            <h2>Smart Search Comment Building</h2>
        </div>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Setup:</h4>
        <p>
            Enter the name of your class and the name of the student you are going to first build a comment for on the "Class Name" and "Student Name" lines respectively. Enter these as you would like them to appear in the comments, so generally just their first/given name. Select what gender the student is.<br><br>
            If you want all comments to start with the same introduction and/or conclusion then enter those on the "Your custom introduction" and "Your custom conclusion" lines.
            You may use the variables CLASS_NAME and STUDENT_NAME in your introduction and conclusion, they will be replaced with the appropriate values when copied.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Building a search pattern:</h4>
        <p>
            You can build the search pattern sentence-by-sentence. So for your first sentence enter text you would like to search for, if any, on the "Search Text" line.
            Check whether you would like to look for this text in the comment text or in the tags. Selecting both will return a comment if it finds the text in either one.
            Select if you would like this comment to have a certain tone (positive, neutral or negative).
            Hit "Add Smart Search" and repeat for all other sentences you would like to add.
            If a search did not return any results or you are unsatisfied with the result, you can modify it below and regenerate.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Just Make Something Up:</h4>
        <p>
            The "Just Make Something Up" button will generate multiple searches using the values you have currently set in the search box..
            So if you would like a random set of all negative comments, just select "Negative" in the "Filter on Tone" box and hit "Just Make Something Up"
            You may select the number of searches you would like this button to pick on the settings tab.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Editing Your Comment:</h4>
        <p>
            Edit comment manually as needed or use the shuffle button to scramble the order of the searches that produced it.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Copying:</h4>
        <p>
            When you are satisfied with the comment you can hit the "Copy Comments" button to copy the entire comment.<br>
            The introduction and conclusion will be added to the beginning and end if you entered them.
            If you put the variables STUDENT_NAME or CLASS_NAME in the intro or conclusion they will be replaced in the copied text.
        </p>

        <h4 class="yellow-color">Smart Search + Multi Student:</h4>
        <p>
            The most powerful way to use this is by combining Multi Student and Smart Search.<br><br>

            To do this first go to the Smart Search tab and make a pattern, this will be the global pattern. After that go to the Multi Student tab, and start adding students as you otherwise normally would there.
            Instead of generating totally random comments it will generate a comment based on the pattern you've just defined. The global pattern will be applied to all of the students added, and you can regenerate their comment and have it conform to that pattern.<br><br>

            If you need to modify the pattern for any particular student(s), you can do that by clicking their menu and then going to "Edit Smart Search". This will take you back to the Smart Search tab where you can fine tune the pattern for individual students.
            The changes you make now will not affect other students, this pattern will be specifically for that student.
            This is helpful if you want to follow the same pattern of subjects for every student, but you would like to make them negative or positive depending on who the student is.
